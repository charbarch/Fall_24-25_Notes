# Memory Forensics

## 1. RAM is Volatile
- **Volatility of RAM**: All data is wiped when the machine is turned off. Memory forensics investigates the volatile memory of a system.
- **Importance**: It can reveal critical information not stored elsewhere, especially during attacks or system breaches, such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) like STUXNET.

## 2. Real-Time Data Capture
- **Immediate Insight**: Memory forensics allows investigators to capture data in real time, providing valuable information during active attacks or suspicious activities.

## 3. Active Processes
- **Analysis of Running Processes**: Investigators can identify currently running processes, threads, and system resources. This helps to detect malicious software that may not have written files to the hard disk or operates entirely in memory.

## 4. Network Connections
- **Examination of Network Activity**: Memory forensics enables the analysis of current network connections and sockets, allowing for the identification of unauthorized remote connections or communications, which may indicate a breach or data exfiltration.

## 5. Encryption Keys and Credentials
- **Sensitive Information Recovery**: Memory often contains encryption keys, passwords, and authentication tokens, which can be crucial for investigations.

## 6. Detailed User Activities
- **Activity Monitoring**: This includes open documents, browser sessions, logins, and other user activities that can provide insights into the user's actions prior to an incident.

## 7. Short-Lived Artifacts
- **Transient Data Analysis**: Memory forensics can recover short-lived artifacts such as memory cache, session information, and clipboard data, which may be significant in understanding recent user activity.
